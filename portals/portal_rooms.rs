//! Portal rooms — a cube with *no walls of its own at all*. Each of its 6
//! faces is nothing but a portal, edge to edge, no doorway cut into a wall
//! and no frame or border around it — the face itself is the entire portal
//! surface. Stand outside it and every face shows a different, fully
//! furnished scene filling it completely — a bedroom through one face, a
//! kitchen through the next, a library, a lounge, a greenhouse, a spa — with
//! nothing marking where the "wall" is, because there isn't one. That's
//! deliberate: without a doorway shape or a frame telling you "this is the
//! portal, right here", it's not obvious at a glance which face is
//! solid-looking-but-isn't, which makes the illusion more disorienting (in a
//! good way) than `portal_cube`'s framed doorways. None of it is faked: each
//! face is a real `helio::Scene::add_portal` pairing that whole face with the
//! real entrance of a real, hand-furnished room built somewhere else in world
//! space, and the engine's own portal pipeline (`helio-pass-portal-cull` /
//! `helio-pass-portal-instances`) does the rest — the only difference from
//! `portal_cube` is that the portal's `half_extent` covers the *entire* face
//! instead of a doorway inset into a wall, and that wall is never built in
//! the first place.
//!
//! Controls:
//!   WASD        — move forward/left/back/right
//!   Space/Shift — move up/down
//!   Mouse drag  — look around (click to grab cursor)
//!   Tab         — toggle editor mode (on by default): shows a checkerboard
//!                 over each portal opening so you can see where it is.
//!   Escape      — release cursor / exit
//!
//! The `portal_rooms_recursive` target uses the same base scene but places a
//! second six-face portal cube inside the red Ember room. Looking through the
//! base cube's red face therefore exercises a real two-link portal chain:
//! base red face -> inner cube face -> inner destination room. The ordinary
//! `portal_rooms` target remains the original, single-level scene.
